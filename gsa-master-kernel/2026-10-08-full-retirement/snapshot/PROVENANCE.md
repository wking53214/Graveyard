# Provenance

## Source

- Source file: `GSA-2.txt`, provided by the user from their local `Downloads` folder.
- Producing AI tool: the transcript's first line states a Google Gemini URL — `https://gemini.google.com/app/a096b251a4ee9b90` — under the heading "GSA (Governance Systems Architecture) Master Kernel." No specific Gemini model version/name is stated anywhere in the transcript body.
- Origin date: unknown. No date or timestamp appears anywhere in the transcript text itself.
- This repo was created on 2026-08-13 from a pre-existing artifact. Git history reflects the archival date, not the artifact's development history. No development chronology is available.

## What the transcript contains

This is a 10-turn conversation. Turns 1, 2, 3, 5 open with the user pasting a code file preceded by a `================================================== SYSTEM System Name: GSA ... Component: ... Status: ... Reasoning: ... Final Python Code:` header banner, and the AI replies with a "🗄️ System Archival Classification & Code Archaeology Report" — a structured report (Part A: summary, Part B: consolidated code, and, in five of these responses, a trailing "📋 Architectural Overview/Pipeline Profile" section) that restates the pasted code, sometimes across several component files concatenated together. Turn 4's prompt is a bare list of names (`MetricsPayload TouchpointChangePayload EvaluationRequest verify_tenant_token() evaluate_environment() system_health()`) rather than a full paste. Turn 6 asks for a single consolidated script; turn 7 is the "OPTION 6 EXECUTION PROTOCOLS" formatting/audit request seen in the user's `RADAR`, `CLIP`, and `AC-HCCSE` archives; turn 8 is a bare refusal ("I cannot fulfill this request.") to "is this a Kernel and if so, what kind?"; turn 9 is the "comprehensive scan and synthesize... wrap in wrapper" mega-prompt seen across several of the user's other archived transcripts; turn 10 is the recurring AST-graph-extractor paste.

Fifteen distinct code blocks were extracted:

| File | Turn | Source | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `artifact_1.py` | 1 (prompt) | User-pasted | `GSARuntimeOrchestrator`, `TraceStore`, `GovernanceLinter`, decorators, exceptions, and a FastAPI `api/server.py`/`routes.py`/`schemas.py`/`middleware.py` set, all concatenated behind repeated `====... SYSTEM ... Component: ...` banners. |
| `artifact_2.py` | 1 (response) | AI-generated | The Archaeology Report's "PART B" consolidated restatement of `artifact_1.py`'s modules — three interleaved section-label lines ("1. Core Platform primitives...", "2. Core Orchestration & Persistence...", "3. Enterprise API Web Tier...") were excluded; see "Extraction: what was stripped." |
| `artifact_3.py` | 2 (prompt) | User-pasted | `GSASubstrateState`, `GSABlackBox`, `IntegrityAuditRedTeam`, `ChronosForesightEngine`, `Omega08Recursion`, `ConstitutionalLayer`, `GaiaInterface`, `HMIDashboard`, `Orchestrator`, with a `STABILIZE_SYSTEM` demonstration. |
| `artifact_4.py` | 2 (response) | AI-generated | The Archaeology Report's consolidated restatement of `artifact_3.py`. |
| `artifact_5.py` | 3 (prompt) | User-pasted | A short FastAPI `evaluate_environment` ingress-node snippet. |
| `artifact_6.py` | 3 (response) | AI-generated | The Archaeology Report's restatement of `artifact_5.py`. |
| `artifact_7.py` | 4 (prompt) | User-pasted | A bare list of six names/call signatures with no surrounding code. |
| `artifact_8.py` | 4 (response) | AI-generated | The Archaeology Report's expansion of the names in `artifact_7.py` into a fuller module. |
| `artifact_9.py` | 5 (prompt) | User-pasted | A `DeterministicPolicyRuntime` module with a `main()` demonstration. |
| `artifact_10.py` | 5 (response) | AI-generated | The Archaeology Report's restatement of `artifact_9.py`. |
| `artifact_11.py` | 6 (response) | AI-generated | A single consolidated script unifying "DIT" and "GSA" layers, produced after the user asked to "merg[e] all aspects of the DIT or GSA contained in this chat" into one final script. |
| `artifact_12.py` | 7 (response) | AI-generated | The "OPTION 6" formatted-and-audited version — headed `"""Program Name: GovernanceSystemsArchitectureMasterKernel..."""` — following a "SECTION 1: CODE ARCHAEOLOGY & SECURITY AUDIT" prose report and a "SECTION 2: PLATFORM CONFIGURATION AND TRANSPORT LAYER" prompt-wrapper section, both excluded (see below). |
| `artifact_13.py` | 9 (response) | AI-generated | The mega-prompt's synthesis response — headed `"""Program Name: GSA_Universal_Cryptographic_Interlock_Engine..."""` — ending with a "Row Count: 288" line, excluded. |
| `artifact_14.py` | 10 (prompt) | User-pasted | The recurring deterministic AST-based graph extractor (`GraphExtractor`, `extract_graph`, `graph_to_dict`) seen across the user's other archived transcripts. |
| `artifact_15.py` | 10 (response) | AI-generated | A `"""Program Name: DeterministicASTGraphExtractor..."""`-headed wrapping of `artifact_14.py`, ending with a "Row Count: 254" line, excluded. |

None of the fifteen files states its own filename inside its own text, so files are numbered `artifact_1.py` … `artifact_15.py` in transcript order, per the fallback naming rule.

## Whether the artifacts execute

All fifteen files were run once each, unmodified, with `python3` (system interpreter). Results span the widest range seen in any of the user's archived transcripts:

- **`artifact_1.py`**: `SyntaxError: invalid character '→' (U+2192)`. This raw paste is flattened onto a single line like the user's other archived raw pastes, but the specific character that stops the parser here is a Unicode arrow (`→`) inside a prose phrase ("Observe → Analyze → Govern → Execute → Explain → Audit") that was pasted directly into what is otherwise Python source text.
- **`artifact_2.py`**: fails with `NameError: name 'Any' is not defined`, reached only after the file successfully parses and begins executing class bodies — it uses `Dict[str, Any]` as a Pydantic field type without importing `Any` from `typing`.
- **`artifact_3.py`**: `SyntaxError: invalid character '“' (U+201C)'`. Same single-line-flattening pattern as `artifact_1.py`, but here the blocking character is a Unicode left double quotation mark (`“salvage decompositions”`) inside prose text pasted alongside the code.
- **`artifact_4.py`**: **runs successfully**, producing real output — a `BLOCKED` result for a "Forbidden Malicious Route" execution attempt, followed by two printed audit-ledger blocks (`GENESIS_DECALOGUE_ACTIVE` and a `STABILIZE_SYSTEM` command record with SHA-256 hash prefixes). No file is written to disk.
- **`artifact_5.py`**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. Standard single-line flattening, no unusual characters involved.
- **`artifact_6.py`**: runs with **no error and no output** — defines a FastAPI route handler with no server startup or `__main__` block.
- **`artifact_7.py`**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. This file is just six space-separated names/call expressions with no valid statement structure regardless of flattening.
- **`artifact_8.py`**: runs with **no error and no output** — no entry point.
- **`artifact_9.py`**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. Standard single-line flattening.
- **`artifact_10.py`**: **runs successfully**, producing real output — a logged `DPR_CORE` execution line followed by two full result dictionaries (status, session ID, telemetry, forensic signature, HMAC auth tag, runtime) for a "Standard Compliant Payload" and a "Non-Compliant Payload (High-Risk Tokens Induced)." No file is written to disk.
- **`artifact_11.py`**: parses and begins executing, then deliberately raises `SystemError: CITADEL_COLLAPSE: DIT/GSA core closed-loop convergence could not achieve parity target bounds.` — this is the script's own designed exception, reached after its retry-loop logic runs to completion without converging; it is not a Python syntax or reference error.
- **`artifact_12.py`**: parses and begins executing, then deliberately raises `SystemError: GSA_PIPELINE_COLLAPSE: Closed-loop policy reconciliation could not attain convergence bounds.` — the same class of designed, self-raised exception as `artifact_11.py`, from equivalent retry-loop logic under a different name.
- **`artifact_13.py`**: runs with **no error and no output** — no entry point.
- **`artifact_14.py`**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. Same single-line-flattening pattern as the AST-extractor pastes in the user's other archived transcripts.
- **`artifact_15.py`**: runs with **no error and no output** — no entry point.

Total files at extraction: 17 (15 artifact files, `TRANSCRIPT.md`,
`PROVENANCE.md`). A `README.md` and Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` were added
2026-09-03 when this material was split out of `GSA-815` into its own
archived repo.

## Tests

No tests exist for any of the fifteen artifacts. No test files, test framework references, or `assert`-based test code appear anywhere in the source transcript. `artifact_3.py`/`artifact_4.py`, `artifact_9.py`/`artifact_10.py`, `artifact_11.py`, and `artifact_12.py` contain `if __name__ == "__main__":` demonstration blocks; the remaining files do not.

## Extraction: what was stripped

Only transport-layer wrapper text was removed; the code itself was copied byte-for-byte from the source `.txt` file (verified against exact character offsets, preserving original CRLF line endings):

- The literal labels `User prompt:` and `Response:` that the transcript export prepends to each turn.
- The chat UI turn separator `________________` that appears between conversation turns.
- In turns 1, 2, 3, 5's responses, the "🗄️ System Archival Classification & Code Archaeology Report" prose (Part A summary) preceding "PART B," and a trailing "📋 Architectural Overview" / "📋 Architectural Pipeline Profile" section following the code, were both excluded — `artifact_2.py`, `artifact_4.py`, `artifact_6.py`, and `artifact_10.py` contain only the "PART B" code itself.
- In turn 1's response specifically, three interleaved numbered-list label lines within "PART B" ("1. Core Platform primitives (core/exceptions.py, core/decorators.py, core/linter.py)", "2. Core Orchestration & Persistence (core/orchestrator.py, core/trace_store.py)", "3. Enterprise API Web Tier (api/schemas.py, api/routes.py, api/middleware.py, api/server.py)") were removed as prose section headers interspersed between code sections — these are unambiguous table-of-contents text (not comments or docstrings), unlike similar-looking header lines kept intact in the user's other archived transcripts (e.g. `AC-HCCSE`'s `Version-Control-ID:` lines), which were kept because they mimicked comment/docstring conventions the AI used consistently elsewhere in that transcript.
- In turn 4's response, an equivalent set of five interleaved numbered labels ("1. API Perimeter & Multi-Tenancy Ingress Gate...", etc., through "5. Output Normalization & Loop Deflection Fence...") appeared consecutively as a single block *before* any code began (not interleaved throughout), so this list was excluded as a unified prose preamble and `artifact_11.py` begins at the first line of actual code.
- In turn 7's response, a "SECTION 1: CODE ARCHAEOLOGY & SECURITY AUDIT (PHASES 1–4)" prose audit and a "SECTION 2: PLATFORM CONFIGURATION AND TRANSPORT LAYER (PHASE 5)" prompt-wrapper section (a "System Prompt Wrapper" instruction block, itself not code) were excluded; `artifact_12.py` begins at the module's own opening `"""Program Name: ...`docstring.
- In turns 9 and 10's responses, the equivalent "SECTION 1" prose audit and "SECTION 2" wrapper-instruction text were excluded the same way, and the trailing "Row Count: 288" / "Row Count: 254" lines following each module's closing `"""` were also excluded as post-code metrics commentary, consistent with how equivalent row-count text was excluded in the user's other archived transcripts.
- Turn 8 (a bare refusal, "I cannot fulfill this request.") contains no code and was not extracted.
- No markdown code fences (```` ``` ````) were present anywhere in the source file — there was nothing of that kind to strip.
- Nothing was stripped from the `.txt` file to build `TRANSCRIPT.md` — that file is the complete source document, copied verbatim, unmodified, including all ten turns' full prompts and responses.

## Duplication

No exact duplication was found among the fifteen kept artifacts — each is materially different code, even where several (`artifact_1.py`/`artifact_2.py`, `artifact_3.py`/`artifact_4.py`, `artifact_5.py`/`artifact_6.py`, `artifact_9.py`/`artifact_10.py`) are a user-paste-and-AI-restatement pair covering the same underlying module: in each such pair, the AI's restatement differs from the original paste (different formatting, added comment banners, and in several cases genuine wording/structure changes), so neither member of any pair is a byte-for-byte copy of the other.

## Things noticed but not fixed

- `artifact_1.py`, `artifact_3.py`, `artifact_5.py`, `artifact_7.py`, `artifact_9.py`, and `artifact_14.py` (the raw user-pasted files) have no recoverable line/indentation structure in the source transcript; each was left as a single flattened line rather than being reformatted into conventionally indented Python.
- `artifact_1.py` and `artifact_3.py` each contain a "smart"/typographic Unicode character (`→` and `“` respectively) embedded directly in otherwise-Python text, which is what actually stops the parser (rather than the flattening alone, which would likely have produced a plain `invalid syntax` error at a different point). Neither character was replaced with its ASCII equivalent.
- `artifact_2.py` uses `Dict[str, Any]` without importing `Any`. Left as written.
- `artifact_11.py` and `artifact_12.py` both reach, and then deliberately raise, a hard-coded `SystemError` from within their own retry/convergence logic when run with their bundled demonstration inputs — this is by design in the code as written (a "give up after N attempts" pattern), not a bug introduced during extraction. Neither script's convergence logic was adjusted to make it "succeed" instead.
- `artifact_7.py` is not really a program on its own — it is a bare list of six names and call-expressions, exactly as the user typed it, with no definitions, imports, or statement structure. It was preserved and tested exactly as it appears, per the archival rule against inventing structure that is not present in the source.
