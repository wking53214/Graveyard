"""The confirm/refine/42 dialogue loop.

CCC already had the primitive this needed: human_resolution.ask()/resolve()
records a set of candidates and a human-attributed choice, gated by
CCC-HUMAN-001 so only a real human can resolve one. That existed, unused,
the whole time the rest of this project kept saying "the dialogue engine
doesn't exist as software." It was half right -- the primitive existed, the
protocol around it didn't: iterate, let "other" branch to new candidates
instead of forcing a pick from a fixed list, and terminate at either a
confirmed choice or an explicit 42 (the record doesn't establish this -- a
complete, honest answer, not a failure, same spirit as Triad-42's "no 42
identified" and CCC's own PROVENANCE_UNCERTAIN).

Scope of "42" here: it is an answer a *human* gives in this loop, meaning the
record does not establish this, and it is recorded as that human's resolution.
Triad-42's "42" is a different mechanism with the same spirit: a machine step
that searches for a high-leverage synthesis, where "no 42 identified" is a
complete result. The two share a name and no code; neither meaning applies in
the other repository.

This is deliberately a thin wrapper, not a reimplementation: every round
still goes through the real ask()/resolve() calls, so the audit trail,
CCC-HUMAN-001 gating, and UncertaintyRecord storage are all the real thing,
not simulated.

        "other" and "42" are always available responses -- do NOT list

        store, unresolved -- an honest record that a dialogue was started
        and not finished, not a leak. Runaway loops (a branch() that never
        stops producing candidates) are bounded by MAX_ROUNDS_CEILING, not
        left to grow.
