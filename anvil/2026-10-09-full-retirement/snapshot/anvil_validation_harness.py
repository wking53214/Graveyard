ANVIL Validation Harness v1.0
===============================================================================

Purpose:
    Proves (or disproves) specific claims made by ANVIL.py — rather than
    just checking "does it run," each test targets one concrete promise
    the code makes about itself and reports PASS/FAIL/FINDING plainly.

How to run:
    python3 anvil_validation_harness.py

    Place this file in the same folder as ANVIL.py before running.

Output:
    A labeled report, grouped into five buckets, in priority order:
      1. Enforcement       - does governance actually block anything?
      2. Integrity Chain   - are hashes deterministic and tamper-evident?
      3. Immutability      - can state be quietly mutated after the fact?
      4. Registry Rules    - are duplicate/unknown/disabled modules blocked?
      5. Full Round-Trip   - does a multi-step chain verify end-to-end?

    A "FINDING" (as opposed to PASS/FAIL) means the code behaved
    consistently and did not crash, but the behavior itself is worth
    William's attention - e.g. "governance ran, but nothing was actually
    checked, because no validator was wired in."
